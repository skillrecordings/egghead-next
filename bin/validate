# Description:
#   Checks for foundation development dependencies. Basically, if it needs to be installed manually
#     by using Homebrew or an installer, it belongs here. If it's a dependency via a package manager
#     then that doesn't need to be checked here. Essentially, this should just ensure that all of
#     the necessary tools to run `bin/setup` are installed properly.
# Usage:
#   bin/doctor
