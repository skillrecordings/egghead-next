All the while, your poor computer screams under the weight of all those tabs.

What about learning from books? Books are great! They're sometimes edited by professionals, which is more than you can say for most tutorials you find. But publishers can’t keep up with the pace of modern web development. You can't keep up either, at least not with your old approach.

Nobody’s paying you to find the bugs in their crummy tutorials. You don’t have time to dig your way out of all those rabbit holes for a supposedly free education.

So you’ve been procrastinating a little. Or… a lot.

Your time is precious. You're a professional.

  Don't you wish you could jack into the Matrix and inject React directly to
  your brain?

Sounds convenient, but it's not going to happen anytime soon.

But what if you had the next best thing?

What if you could simply sit down and start learning? What if you could skip all the searching, the cobbling, the contradictory advice, the bugs, the forums, and the dead ends?

What if you had on-demand experts avaliable to hand you the best, curated material on modern web development?

Think how much easier it would be for you to stay on the bleeding edge of our industry. With just 10-30 minutes a day, you'd be able to power through a major topic every week.

With the right teacher and the right courses, this isn't a pipe dream.
Picture yourself months from now, sitting down to a heady programming challenge, and whispering I know wtf I am doing.

That is what egghead can do for you.
