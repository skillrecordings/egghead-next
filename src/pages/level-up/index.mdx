## Plan out your next career move with egghead

The job hunt job can be complex, counterintuitive, stressful and just plain frustrating.

As web developers, we usually have to go it alone too.

At egghead we've got a lot of experience in this industry and a community of web
developers like you that want to get good or better jobs in the software industry.

### How can we help you?

We'd like to chat about your career, finding jobs, focusing on the right skills so
that you are ready for opportunities when they arrive.

If you are open to it, we'd love to chat with you to:

- Brainstorm the next step in your career.
- Critically assess your "_this is what I need to do to get a job_" thought process.
- Find out what strategies other developers have employed to (successfully) land a job.
- Co-create your "land a job" to-do list.
- Just talk to someone about how things are going for you.

We can't promise that the job hunt will be any easier, but we can promise that a
real person/team will hear you out, help you chart out next steps, and root for
your success.
