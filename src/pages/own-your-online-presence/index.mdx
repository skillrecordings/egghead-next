Are you...

- _Looking for a **new job**?_
- _Trying to make a **good impression** to the people making hiring decisions?_
- _Worried about how you're being **perceived online**?_

A collection of templates, guides, and resources to spruce up your online presence and make a great first impression.

## Why pay attention to your online presence?

1. **The people making hiring decisions _will_ Google you.** It's usually the first thing they do — your online presence is your first impression. Make sure it makes you look good.

2. **Control what people know about you before you meet IRL.** If your work, thoughts, or hobbies are online, you might want to control which ones show up or, more importantly, which ones show up _first_.

3. **Put your best foot forward.** Take a look at yourself through the internet's eyes and optimize what you see. Help Google showcase your best self.

## How it works

### Stage 1: Take stock of what's out there

Google yourself. See what shows up. Get a sense of how people are piecing the real you together.

### Stage 2: Build the right tone

Work backwards from the kind of job you want to figure out what kind of impression you need to make.

### Stage 3: Damage control

Edit and update your social media, GitHub, and personal website.

### Stage 4: Strategic additions

Take it to the next level by adding content to appeal to the hirers you're specifically interested in.
