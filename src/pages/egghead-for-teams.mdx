Keeping your team up to date and consistent with the application of frameworks, patterns, and best practices is an ongoing and extreme challenge for any organization.

The pressure is always on to SHIP, which means that we have to make trade-offs in terms of how we spend our time. When the ongoing education and upskilling of your team is neglected the long-term consequences can be massive... and expensive.

On the flip side of that coin, when continued education and upskilling is a priority, the long-term consequences can still be massive, but instead of a massive expense, you will see a massive ROI.

Access to high-quality learning material, and the space to learn, is essential for the developers on your team.

- high quality product development
- consistent shared knowledge and understanding of tools
- alignment on best practices
- similar basis for understanding around "how we got here"
