Please contact **[support@egghead.io](mailto:support@egghead.io)** to request a refund.

Our refund policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase or last renewal, unfortunately, we can’t offer you a refund.

If you are issued a refund, it will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 5-10 business days.

If you haven’t received your refund after 10 business days, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
