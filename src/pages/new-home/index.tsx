              sometimes edited by professionals, which is more than you can say

              not with your old approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nobodyâ€™s paying you to find the bugs in their crummy tutorials.
              You donâ€™t have time to dig your way out of all those rabbit holes
              for a supposedly free education.
