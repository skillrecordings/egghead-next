            What about learning from books? Books are great! <br /> They're
            sometimes edited by professionals, which is more than you can say
            for most tutorials you find. But publishers canâ€™t keep up with the
            pace of modern web development. You can't keep up either, at least
            not with your old approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nobodyâ€™s paying you to find the bugs in their crummy tutorials. You
            donâ€™t have time to dig your way out of all those rabbit holes for a
            supposedly free education.

          <p>So youâ€™ve been procrastinating a little. Orâ€¦ a lot.</p>

            What if you could simply sit down and start learning? What if you

            Think how much easier it would be for you to <i>stay</i> on the
            bleeding edge of our industry. With just 10-30 minutes a day, you'd

            With the right teacher and the right courses, this isn't a pipe
