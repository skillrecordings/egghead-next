# Create Script with TypeScript and Bun

- Create executable TypeScript scripts in a "./scripts" directory in the root of the project
- Use a `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang so it can be run with "./scripts/script-name.ts"
- Use `chmod +x` to make the script executable

**REMEMBER: All scripts should be TypeScript files in the scripts directory with bun shebang and executable permissions.**
