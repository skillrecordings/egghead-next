# Guiding Principles

1. **Observability:** Add excessive logging.
2. **Many Small Files:** ALWAYS prefer creating new files over adding to existing ones.
3. **Micro-Milestones:** Perform work in commit-sized chunks. Optimize for easy rewinding.

**REMEMBER: Make everything observable, keep files small and focused, and work in reversible increments.**
