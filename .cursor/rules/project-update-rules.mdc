# Update Project Context File: .cursor/rules/_project.mdc

**Your primary task: Meticulously update the `./cursor/rules/_project.mdc` file. Use ONLY information found within the current project's files and documentation.**

## File Existence Check

Quickly list potential configuration files and docs:

```bash
ls . docs
```

Use the output to see which files are available to read.

## 1. Core Objective

Your goal is to populate the `./cursor/rules/_project.mdc` file. This file must accurately reflect the project's current configuration, technology stack, structure, standards, and tooling, serving as a central project reference.

## 2. Information Gathering (Strictly from Project Sources)

Follow these steps precisely to gather the necessary information:

### Step 1: Analyze Project Root & Configuration Files:
- List all files and directories in the project root.
- Identify and thoroughly read relevant configuration files. Examples include (but are not limited to):
    - Package management: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`
    - Build tools & bundlers: `webpack.config.js`, `vite.config.js`, `rollup.config.js`, `tsconfig.json` (check for `compilerOptions`, `extends`, etc.)
    - Framework specific: `next.config.js`, `angular.json`, `vue.config.js`, `svelte.config.js`
    - Linters & formatters: `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintignore`, `.prettierrc.js`, `.prettierignore`, `biome.json`, `ruff.toml`, `.editorconfig`
    - CI/CD: Files in `.github/workflows/`, `gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `Dockerfile`
    - Testing: `jest.config.js`, `vitest.config.js`, `cypress.json`, `playwright.config.js`
- From these files, extract details about dependencies (and their versions), scripts (build, dev, test), language versions, tool configurations, and project settings.

### Step 2: Review Documentation and Key Code Directories:
- Thoroughly read all files located within the `docs/` directory (and its subdirectories). Prioritize `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, architecture diagrams, technical specifications, or any documents describing the project's setup, conventions, and purpose.
- Examine the structure of main source directories (e.g., `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `packages/`) to understand module organization and identify key architectural patterns.

## 3. Updating `./cursor/rules/_project.mdc`

### Step 3: Populate the Template:
- Open the `./cursor/rules/_project.mdc` file for editing.
- Using the information gathered in Steps 1 and 2, meticulously fill in each section of the template provided below.
- **Crucial:** Adhere strictly to the template's structure and placeholders. Provide specific examples and details where requested (e.g., actual library names, version numbers, file paths).
- **Handling Missing Information:** If, after thorough investigation, specific information required by the template cannot be definitively found within the project's files or `docs/` directory, explicitly state `[Information not found in project context]` or `[N/A]` in the corresponding field. **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT invent, infer, or use external knowledge.** It is critical to indicate missing information rather than provide incorrect data.

## 4. Output Requirements

- Your SOLE output must be the fully updated content of the `./cursor/rules/_project.mdc` file.
- Ensure the output is valid Markdown.

---
**REMEMBER: Your objective is to produce an accurate, detailed, and comprehensive `./cursor/rules/_project.mdc` file. This file MUST be populated using *only* information extracted directly from THIS project's codebase and its documentation. Adhere strictly to the provided template. After updating the file with all available project-specific information (or marking details as 'not found'), your task is complete.**

# [Project Name] - Project Rules

## 1. Project Overview

goal: [Concisely describe the main purpose and goal of the project. What problem does it solve? Source from README or project vision docs.]
type: [e.g., Web Application, CLI Tool, Library, Mobile App, Backend API, Monorepo. Determine from project structure and build files.]
key features:
- [core functionality or feature 1, derived from docs or main modules]
- [core functionality or feature 2, derived from docs or main modules]
- [core functionality or feature 3, derived from docs or main modules]

## 2. Technology Stack

language(s): [e.g., TypeScript 5.x (from tsconfig.json or package.json), Python 3.11 (from pyproject.toml or runtime checks), Go 1.23 (from go.mod), Java 17 (from pom.xml or build.gradle)]
framework(s): [e.g., Next.js 15 (App Router - check next.config.js, package.json), React 19 (package.json), FastAPI (pyproject.toml, main app file), Spring Boot (pom.xml), SvelteKit (svelte.config.js)]
ui library/styling: [e.g., Tailwind CSS v4 (tailwind.config.js, package.json), Shadcn UI (components.json, registry), Material UI (package.json), CSS Modules (file extensions, build config)]
database(s): [e.g., PostgreSQL via Prisma (schema.prisma, package.json), MongoDB (connection strings, package.json), Supabase (config, client usage), SQLite via Drizzle (drizzle.config.js, package.json)]
state management: [e.g., Zustand (package.json, store files), React Context (usage in components), Redux (package.json, store setup), Pinia (package.json, store setup), None (Local State - if no dedicated library found)]
api layer: [e.g., REST (via Next.js API Routes/FastAPI), GraphQL (schema files, Apollo/Relay packages), tRPC (router definitions, client setup)]
key libraries:
- [critical dependency 1 (e.g., `axios` for HTTP, `date-fns` for dates - from package.json/pyproject.toml etc.)]
- [critical dependency 2 (e.g., `zod` for validation, `pino` for logging)]

## 3. Project Structure

main source directory: [e.g., src/, app/, packages/ - identify primary code location]
core directories: [Verify existence and common usage patterns]
- components/: [e.g., Reusable UI elements - if applicable]
- lib/ or utils/: [e.g., Shared utility functions - if applicable]
- services/ or api/: [e.g., Business logic, API interactions - if applicable]
- types/ or interfaces/: [e.g., Shared type definitions - if applicable]

version control: [e.g., Git. Check for Conventional Commits (commitlint.config.js, `CONTRIBUTING.md`), PRs to `main`/`master` branch (from `CONTRIBUTING.md` or repo settings if accessible).]
ci/cd: [e.g., GitHub Actions (check `.github/workflows/`), GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`), Jenkins (`Jenkinsfile`) - specify main jobs like lint, test, build on PR.]
ide recommendations: [e.g., VS Code with specific extensions (check `.vscode/extensions.json`). If not found, state `[N/A]`.]

## 8. (Optional) Database / API Guidelines

[Source from `docs/database.md`, `docs/api_guidelines.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or inline comments in DB/API code. If none, state `[N/A]`.]
- [e.g., Use ORM methods only, No direct SQL unless approved]
- [e.g., RESTful principles for API design, specific error response format]
- [e.g., Guidelines for database migrations (e.g., use Alembic, Prisma Migrate)]

## 9. (Optional) Specific Feature Rules

[Source from dedicated docs for complex features (e.g., `docs/authentication.md`, `docs/i18n.md`). If none, state `[N/A]`.]
- [e.g., Authentication: JWT-based, specific token handling procedures]
- [e.g., Internationalization (i18n): Use i18next, key naming conventions]
- [e.g., State Management: Rules for creating new stores, selector patterns]

## 10. (Optional) Rule Referencing

[If this project uses other `.mdc` rule files, list them here. Check the `.cursor/rules/` directory. If none, state `[N/A]`.]
- [e.g.,
  - See [typescript.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc) for detailed TS rules.
  - Follow guidelines in [auth.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/auth.mdc) for authentication.
