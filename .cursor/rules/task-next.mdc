# Propose Next Development Task

**Your primary task: Identify and recommend the most logical next development task based on the current project state and goals.**

## File Existence Check

Check for key documentation files first:

```bash
ls . docs
```

Use these results to inform your analysis.

To achieve this, follow these thought processes:

1.  **Understand Context:**
    - Review relevant project documentation (e.g., files in `docs/`, `README.md`).
    - Analyze current project requirements. If a `.cursor/rules/req-task.mdc` (or similar) file exists and is relevant, consult it for specific task requirements or context.
    - Consider the most recent actions, discussions, or completed work in the project.

2.  **Identify Potential Tasks:**
    - Based on your understanding, brainstorm a list of 3-5 potential next tasks that would advance the project.

3.  **Evaluate and Recommend:**
    - From your list, select the single most logical and impactful task to undertake next.
    - Clearly state your recommendation.
    - Provide concise reasoning for your choice, explaining why it's the most appropriate next step (e.g., dependency for other tasks, highest priority, unblocks other work).

**Output Expectation:**

Your response should clearly state:
1.  **Recommended Next Task:** [Describe the task]
2.  **Reasoning:** [Explain why this task is recommended]
3.  **(Optional) Alternative Tasks:** [Briefly list 1-2 other potential tasks considered]

**REMEMBER: Your goal is to provide a well-reasoned recommendation for the single most impactful next development task.**
