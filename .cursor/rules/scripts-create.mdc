# Create Executable TypeScript Scripts with Bun

**Your task: Create new, executable TypeScript scripts within a `scripts` directory, runnable with `bun`.**

## File Existence Check

See if the `scripts/` directory already exists:

```bash
ls . docs
```

Then follow the steps below.

Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Ensure `scripts` Directory:** If it doesn't already exist, create a `scripts/` directory in the project root.
2.  **Create Script File:** Inside the `scripts/` directory, create your new TypeScript file (e.g., `scripts/my-new-script.ts`).
3.  **Add Bun Shebang:** Make the first line of your script: `#!/usr/bin/env bun`.
4.  **Write TypeScript Code:** Implement the script's logic in TypeScript. Ensure the code is compatible with Node.js execution environments where possible, even though `bun` is the primary runner.
5.  **Make Executable:** After saving the script, make it executable by running the command: `chmod +x scripts/your-script-name.ts` (replace `your-script-name.ts` with the actual filename).

**REMEMBER: The final script must be a TypeScript file located in the `scripts/` directory, start with the `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang, and be executable (`chmod +x`).**
