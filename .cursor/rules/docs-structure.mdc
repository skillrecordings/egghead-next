# Generate `docs/STRUCTURE.md` for Project File Organization

**Your task: Create a new file at `docs/STRUCTURE.md` that outlines the recommended file and directory structure for this project, along with guiding principles.**

## File Existence Check

Before analyzing, verify which documentation files are present:

```bash
ls . docs
```

Use this to know your available references.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Analyze Documentation:**
    - Thoroughly review all files within the `docs/` directory (e.g., `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, architecture documents).
    - Look for any existing descriptions, guidelines, or discussions related to the project's intended file structure, module organization, or component layout.

2.  **Define Structure & Best Practices:**
    - Based on your findings (and general best practices if no specific information is available), define a clear and logical file/directory structure for the project.
    - Consider common conventions for the project's language(s) and framework(s).
    - Outline key top-level directories (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `config/`) and their purposes.
    - Suggest organization for common components like source code, tests, utilities, configurations, etc.
    - Include any specific naming conventions if identified or appropriate.

3.  **Create `docs/STRUCTURE.md`:**
    - Write the content for the `docs/STRUCTURE.md` file.
    - The document should be well-organized, using Markdown for clarity (headings, lists, code blocks for examples if useful).
    - It should clearly explain the purpose of major directories and provide guidance on where to place new files or modules.

**Output:**

Your primary output is the complete content for the new `docs/STRUCTURE.md` file.

After providing this file content, give a brief executive summary of the recommended structure so the user can quickly understand the key directories and their purposes. Keep this summary separate from the file content.

**REMEMBER: The goal is to produce a `docs/STRUCTURE.md` file that serves as a practical guide for organizing files and directories within this project, promoting consistency and maintainability.**
